Portfolio Website Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 

Summary: 
This is a student website I created using mainly HTML and CSS, with a few JavaScript additions. Features a homepage, about me section, resume section, and project section. There's a drop down menu feature and icons that allow viewers to reach me in different ways. 

Motivation: 
I decided to build this website to expand my technological and programming skills to include web development. This is a project where I am developing skills and my creativity.
